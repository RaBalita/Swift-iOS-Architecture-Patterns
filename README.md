# Swift-iOS-Architecture-Patterns

This is an exploration of several architectures for an iOS project.

The goal is to test several architectural patterns, for the same app. 

## App description

This app will help future VTOL-pilots during their flights.

### Use cases

1. A pilot gets information regarding time to destination, power consumption, FATO availability, parking availability.
1. A pilot selects his destination among the list of vertiports.
1. A pilot shares information regarding its passengers and flight details.
2. A pilot sees his expected trajectory and alternative routes.

## Showcased Architectures

The structures showcased in this repo are:

1. Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
2. View-Interactor-Presenter-Entity-Router (VIPER)
3. The elm architecture
